### Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM) (1 of 3)

- VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask) allows subnets to be further subdivided into smaller and smaller groupings until each subnet is about the same size as the necessary IP address space
  - This is often referred to as “subnetting a subnet”
- To create VLSM subnets, you create the largest subnet first
  - Then, you create the next largest subnet, and the next one, and so on
