Mobile phones, a common item in life, are currently used by almost half of the world's population, and this number is increasing every day. However, this industrial activity is a global problem that affects humans and ecosystems.

This is a disaster for the environment because the process of manufacturing mobile phones can pollute the atmosphere and destroy ecosystems. When extracting trace elements, wastewater can seep into soil and water and pollute river systems and drinking water. Additionally, the metal extracted from gold mines is used in the manufacture of mobile phones, and it is worth noting that gold mining is one of the main causes of deforestation. This production process and the use of cell phones produces more greenhouse gasses than any other electronic device (CITE). To make matters worse, many consumers replace their phones every two years, and in most cases, the phones are replaced when they are still functional, but decommissioned devices are not recycled, and their components are left to simply depreciate in value (CITE).


If these products end up in landfills, the toxic metals in cell phones will still continue to contaminate water and soil; thus, changing consumer habits can improve e-waste management.  Collecting old cell phones to recycle their materials is profitable, and at the same time, it will encourage recycling companies to develop more efficient recycling technologies and strategies. 

Smartphones have changed human life and the world in a very short period of time. Today's mobile phone is the vehicle to the online world, a tool for connecting people almost anywhere, anytime. People can still send emails while traveling, or keep in touch with loved ones 24 hours a day. In the case of cell phone users in the United States, the average cell phone usage time is about two years. Although its lifespan could be longer, users are often tempted to replace their phones early because the new contract schemes make the new phone appear to be a free gift, or the phone's accessories such as broken screen or battery failure, making repairs cumbersome and expensive, and the user has to throw it away or trade it in for a newer model. Cell phone companies need to be prohibited from advertising for the replacement of old phones without the marketing option for choosing recycled products, and recycling old products. In addition, consumers should prolong the service life of products as much as possible, support more telephone repair companies, and make the use of repaired products more common (CITE everything in this paragraph).

According to Nathan (2018), 151 million cell phones are thrown away in the United States every year. The total amount of e-waste has continued to grow in recent years. According to lan (2021), global e-waste generation reached 53.6 million tons in 2019, an increase of 21% over the past five years. Another set of astonishing data is mentioned in the shari (2019) report. The global e-waste is worth more than 62.6 billion US dollars a year, exceeding the GDP of most countries. However, only 20% of electronic products are disposed of. Of the 80% of e-waste that is not recycled or dismantled into various parts and reused, it is treated as garbage, taken for incineration or landfill, or sold to developing countries where they are often mined. The recycling of valuable metal elements in e-waste is known as urban mining. In remote environments, miners mine tons of metal ores and precious metals for use by mobile phone manufacturers. These mined metal minerals need to be refined and processed through complex procedures, and workers are often unknowingly exposed to chemicals that are harmful to their health (CITE).

Lanâ€™s (2021) report also stated that an average of 7.3 kg of e-waste was discarded per person, per year over the past five years. E-waste contains mercury that can damage the human brain and coordination system. Nonetheless, some people may not dispose of discarded mobile phones for the following reasons:

1. Lack of knowledge.
Although people know they should not directly throw e-waste into the trash can, people are not sure what else to do with them.
2. Value.
Most consumers believe that idle electronics have at least some monetary value, and consumers do not consider their idle electronics to be waste, especially if they are not faulty.
3. Nostalgia / backup psychology.
Electronic products that carry emotional memories make it difficult for consumers to give them up. Some consumers regard mobile phones that are not currently in use as backup products and think that they will have the opportunity to use them in the future.
4. Convenience
Consumers consider convenience in almost everything they do, but even if there are convenient recycling channels, they still find it troublesome because most people think that the urgency of recycling electronic products is low.

The recycling revolution still faces many challenges. Another difficulty is that it is very difficult to recycle and dispose of electronic waste in an environmentally friendly way. It not only requires sufficient technology to separate valuable metals , but also needs to have a way to deal with the subsequent chemical agents. This work is very complicated and requires a lot of capital investment, and there is not necessarily a way to make enough profits (CITE).
According to a report published in Jack (2015), Guiyu Town, a city in southern China, is a well-known location for e-waste disposal. The city receives about 15,000 tons of garbage every day including iron, aluminum parts, and other accessories that will be discarded and incinerated. This extraction method is also harmful to the environment and people's health. The report states that 80% of the children living in the city for a long time have high blood lead levels. Such recycling methods are worrisome because they pass the cost on to the environment and the health of the residents, so in the end, the consequences may outweigh the profit. 
The first way to improve this problem is publicity and education to popularize the concept. Additionally, companies must begin offering processes that incorporate new methods which take into consideration the obligations of electronic waste recycling, and establish a supervision mechanism to follow up on these new processes. Furthermore, consumers should try to ask brands to offer product recycling services. It is a responsibility of the consumer to return the product to the producer for recycling when available (CITE). Another way to help solve this issue is to reduce the use of electronic products by trying to extend their length of the use, reduce elimination, and reduce the amount of new production from the source. For example, idle mobile phones can be given to relatives and friends to extend the service life of the product. Or a person can exchange products they no longer need for other products through formal exchange platforms (CITE).
Finally, an environmentally friendly recycling industry chain should be established so that those engaged in this work can achieve a balance between environmental protection and income. In addition to the need for government departments to issue effective measures, it is also necessary to combine financial support from electronic product manufacturers and other stakeholders. In the production process, the product should be redesigned from the perspective of easy maintenance, reusable components, more recycled materials, less toxic and harmful substances, and reduced energy consumption. A good product design, in addition to extending product life, is beneficial to the environment and health, and also improves the economy of recycling renewable resources (CITE).
Overall, consumers should consider whether they really need these products. Furthermore, reducing the emission of electronic wastes can really reduce damage to the environment. Helping people clearly understand recycling information, emphasizing the value of electronic products, and improving the convenience of recycling are the factors that determine whether the recycling of mobile phones can be successful.
