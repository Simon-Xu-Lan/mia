According to statistics, almost half of the world's population use mobile phones and this number is increasing every day, this industrial activity is a global problem affecting people and ecosystems.
It's a disaster for the environment, because the manufacture of mobile phones requires the extraction of trace elements from the earth, and in addition to polluting the atmosphere, the process destroys ecosystems, creating pollution that seeps into soil and water, contaminating river systems and drinking water , while the source of components in mobile phones is the culprit, gold mining is one of the main causes of deforestation, smartphones generate more greenhouse gases than any other consumer electronics device, and what's worse, the average user every two years Swap out a phone, and in most cases it's replaced when it's still functional, but there's no recycling of decommissioned devices whose components are left in drawers and depreciate in value.
If these products end up in landfills, the toxic metals in mobile phones will still continue to contaminate water and soil, so changing consumer habits can improve e- waste management, collect more old smartphones, and recycle their materials become more profitable, which in turn will incentivize waste management companies to invest in the development of efficient recycling technologies, appropriately prohibit the replacement of phone service marketing advertisements with greener trade-in advertisements, and it makes sense to extend their useful life as long as possible, Supporting more phone repair companies and using repaired products become more common are effective measures worth trying.
Smartphones have revolutionized human life and the world in a short period of time. Think back to all the changes that the first smartphone brought to life since then, the mobile phone has become a vehicle to the online world, a tool for finding people almost anytime and anywhere. People can send emails while traveling, or keep in touch with their loved ones 24 hours a day, and answer all their strange curiosity at all times. Taking cell phone users in the US as an example, a cell phone will last about 2 years more on average, although it can actually last longer,mobile phone users are often tempted to replace their phones early, such as a new contract scheme that makes the new phone appear to be a free gift, or just one of the parts of the phone, such as a broken screen or battery, which is cumbersome and expensive to repair, these situations force users to throw away their old phones.
According to this trend and reason, it is calculated that everyone will have at least 29 mobile phones in their lifetime, and 151 million mobile phones will be discarded in the United States every year. The total amount of e-waste has continued to grow in recent years. In 2014, the total amount of e-waste in the world was about 44.4 million metric tons, and it has gradually increased every year since then. In 2019, it has increased by 21%, which is the fastest growing type of waste. According to United Nations estimates, e-waste is likely to increase to 74 million tons a year by 2030, which is 66% more than in 2014

The proportion of electronic products that are disposed of is only 20%, and 80% of the electronic waste that is not recycled is not only dismantled into various parts and reused, but also treated as garbage, incinerated or buried, or It is sold to developing countries, where various chemical or electrical methods are used to recycle the valuable metal elements in e-waste, which is called urban mining. But whether it is incineration, burial, or urban mining, these will almost pollute the environment and even affect human health.
Manufacturers arrange for miners to mine tons of metallic ore and precious metals in remote environments for accessories in mobile phones. These mined metal minerals need to be refined and processed through complex procedures before they can be supplied to the supply chain in large quantities. Workers in electronics factories are often unknowingly exposed to dangerous chemicals that can harm their health. These factories run on fossil fuels, the burning of which contributes to climate change.
Another reason is that the design of smartphones, such as tightly bonded batteries, makes it difficult to disassemble them, so the way to recycle them is to shred them before sending them for smelting. In small electronic devices, there are many kinds of materials and substances in small amounts, which is the factor that the recycled materials cannot be effectively smelted. For the IT industry, the recycling revolution still faces many challenges, and shifting production to a circular model that reuses precious raw materials is a good solution.
According to research, the average person on the planet discards 7.3 kilograms of electronic waste. E-waste poses health and environmental hazards, containing toxic additives or harmful substances such as mercury that can damage the human brain and coordination system. And people do not dispose of discarded mobile phones mainly for the following reasons:
1. Cognitive barriers, do not know how to deal with them
Although people know that it is not possible to directly throw waste electronic products into the trash can, people not sure and have not studied how to deal with it.
2. Hope to exchange the phone for good value
Most consumers believe that idle electronics have at least some monetary value, and more importantly, consumers do not consider their idle electronics to be waste, especially if they are not broken. Therefore, recycling programs called for electronic waste and discarded electronic products may not receive electronic products that are still usable or considered valuable.
3. Nostalgia and backup psychology
Electronic products that carry emotional memories make it difficult for consumers to give up, and make them feel that recycling is a waste. At the same time, some

consumers regard electronic products that are not currently in use as spare tires and think that they have the opportunity to use them in the future.
4. Consideration of convenience
Consumers consider convenience in almost everything they do, but even if there are convenient recycling channels, they still find it troublesome, because most people think that the urgency of recycling electronic products is low.
The concern of discarding mobile phones as an environmental issue is gradually rising in many countries. How to deal with this thorny issue effectively requires the public to understand that this work is not easy to handle properly and quickly.
In addition to people's reluctance to dispose of discarded mobile phones, the difficulty of recycling is mainly because it is very difficult to recycle and dispose of electronic waste in an environmentally friendly way. It not only requires sufficient technology to separate valuable metals, but also has Methods to deal with subsequent chemical agents. Therefore, this work is very complicated and requires a lot of capital investment, and there is not necessarily a way to make enough profits.
According to the data, it is mainly high-income countries that have done a good job of safe and pollution-free recycling. However, there are also many developing countries with industries responsible for recycling e-waste, such as China, India, Ghana and Nigeria, to name a few. But the local residents who make a living basically only select the part that can make a profit, or choose the e-waste that is easy to deal with, and the other parts are ignored.
In Guiyu Town, a city in southern China, for example, many locals dispose of discarded mobile phones only to pick out parts that can be refined into gold, copper, iron, and aluminum, and other things are thrown away. In addition, the way they extract will also bring a lot of pollution. For example, the common "high temperature baking" will cause air pollution, and the chemical wastewater produced by "pickling" is almost all directly discharged into the river. It can even be considered that the recycling in these developing countries is not a complete and pollution-free recycling, but only by transferring the cost to the environment and residents' health, so as to make a profit.
There are several different measures to improve the recycling of discarded mobile phones. The first is publicity and education, so that people have the concept of recycling, specific procedures, methods and responsibilities and obligations, and establishing a supervision and prevention mechanism is one of the most important measures. Consumers should try to ask the brand or a third-party company designated by the brand to provide product recycling services. It is a responsibility and obligation to return the product to the producer for recycling, and it is also an important step for the producer to fulfill the extension of producer responsibility.

People have reason to believe that the real developed countries do not have a high GDP, but have achieved as much circular economy as possible.
The second is to reduce the use of electronic products, try to extend the length of the use of electrical appliances, reduce elimination, and reduce the amount from the source is the most effective. For example, you can send an idle mobile phone to a friend to continue to extend the service life of the product. Or try to exchange products you no longer need for other useful things through a formal exchange platform. If you want to replace the old mobile phone, consumers can contact the official channel to try whether there is a trade-in service.
Finally, it is also a very important thing to establish a sound e-waste recycling technology and industry, so that the industry can take into account environmental protection and income.
In addition to the need for government departments to issue effective measures, it is also necessary to combine financial support from various aspects such as electronic product manufacturers. In the production process, the product needs to be redesigned from the perspective of easy maintenance, reusable components, improved material recycling rate, no toxic and harmful substances used in raw materials and manufacturing processes, and reduced energy consumption. A good product design, in addition to extending product life, is also beneficial to the environment and health, and improves the economy of recycling renewable resources.
In general, as the upgrading of technology products is getting faster, consumers are caught in the fanatical pursuit of technology products. At the same time, discarded e- waste is silently sent to developing countries, seriously affecting the environment and the health of local people. Giving more people the opportunity to clearly understand recycling information, providing monetary and social good incentives, emphasizing the value of electronic products instead of calling it electronic waste, providing a simpler data management system, and improving recycling convenience is the decision to recycling The success of the work of the mobile phone.
