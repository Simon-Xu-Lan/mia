"""CP1401 - Practical 10 - Debugging.
Explain the problems (not the solution, not the style issues):

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'NoneType' in line 25

Describe your debugging process:

After testing the code several times, I found the nonetype error happens if result is not negative.
So I guess there is something wrong in the if and elif branch in function play.
I found there is no return in if an elif branch.

Fix the code in-place below
