# Bio Energy
## Background
- Bioenergy is one of many diverse resources available to help meet our demand for energy. It is a form of renewable energy that is derived from recently living organic materials known as biomass, which can be used to produce transportation fuels, heat, electricity, and products.
- Biomass means "natural material." When biomass is burned, it releases heat, just like the wood logs in your campfire. 
- Biomass energy uses natural materials like trees and plants to make electricity. It can also mean waste products like trash. 
- It is the second-most common form of renewable energy we use in the United States, providing enough electricity to power more than two million homes.
- All living things and organic matter are known as biomass. The energy released from biomass when it is eaten, burned, or converted into fuels is called biomass energy. This includes wood, wood waste, straw, manure,



## Advantages
- It is a renewable source of energy, which means that it will not run out as long as it is replaced, for example by growing more crops or trees.
- Although carbon dioxide and methane gases are released when biomass is burned, the plants absorbed carbon dioxide when they were growing. So the only additional carbon dioxide that is emitted is from farm machinery used in the process.
- It can use waste materials to produce electricity.
- It supports farmers because they can sell their crops for biomass fuel.
- Abundant and renewable bioenergy can contribute to a more secure, sustainable, and economically sound future by:
    - Supplying domestic clean energy sources
    - Reducing dependence on foreign oil
    - Generating jobs
    - Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction

## Disadvantages
Are there any drawbacks to biomass energy? Some of the negatives to using biomass energy include: 
- Air pollution from burning Releasing green house gasses such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
- Burning trash and waste can release harmful chemicals and gasses into the environment. 
- The land cleared for growing corn and sugar cane can reduce habitats and destroy ecosystems.
- The land used for growing biomass could be used to grow other crops for food.
- Growing biomass can use fertilizers and other chemicals that can cause water pollution.
- Burning biomass does produce some carbon dioxide and methane gas overall, which contributes towards global warming, but in general, it can be thought of as almost carbon-neutral.
- Biomass production can encourage intensive farming and may contribute towards deforestation if new trees are not planted.
- Growing and collecting the biomass can sometimes cause problems. It can be heavy and may need to be transported long distances.
- If food crops are used for fuel this can make them more expensive to buy as food.

## Overall conclution
- Despite all the negatives associated with biomass energy, many people believe that it is a better and cleaner alternative to burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal.
- To conclude, while many may believe that bio energy has all the negatives, the fossil fuels they frequently promote are a greater threat, and bio energy are in fact a better and cleaner alternative, both economically and environmentally.
